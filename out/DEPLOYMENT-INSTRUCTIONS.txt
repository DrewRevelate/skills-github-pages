MANUAL DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS
==============================

Your static site has been built and is ready for deployment to Vercel.
Follow these steps to deploy:

1. Go to https://vercel.com/ and log in or create an account

2. Click "Add New..." > "Project"

3. Import your project from Git or upload the 'out' folder directly:
   - If uploading: Select all files in the 'out' directory and drag them to the Vercel import area
   - If using Git: Connect your repository and select it

4. Configure the project settings:
   - Framework Preset: Other
   - Build Command: No need to specify (we've already built the site)
   - Output Directory: .  (just a dot, since we're uploading the 'out' directory directly)

5. Click "Deploy"

6. After deployment, you can:
   - Set up a custom domain (fullthrottle.revelateops.com)
   - Configure environment variables if needed
   - Manage other settings from the Vercel dashboard

Note: If you want to use a custom domain, go to the project settings in Vercel,
click on "Domains" and follow the instructions to add your domain.
